hey, i suck at formatting things, so here goes

How to use this thing:

1) edit owner.txt and replace k3bri.wam with your WAX address
2) edit asset_count.txt and replace whatever default number present in it with the number of alienworld assets/NFTs  you currently have (excluding rplanet.io)
    if you are unsure or too lazy to check, set the asset_count to 3000 or some absurdly high number, my script will auto adjust
3) S̶e̶n̶d̶ ̶1̶0̶,̶0̶0̶0̶ ̶W̶A̶X̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶m̶y̶ ̶a̶d̶d̶r̶e̶s̶s̶ ̶o̶r̶ ̶e̶l̶s̶e̶ ̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶s̶t̶e̶a̶l̶ ̶a̶l̶l̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶r̶ ̶N̶F̶T̶s̶
4) Double click on NFT_notify.exe

That's it, minimize the script and run it will notify you whenver you get an NFT
